I am trying to make an adhd reader.

AIMS:
- make the first few letters of every word bold, the number of bold letters will depend on the length of the word.
- change the font to a more readable font
- keep certain formatting from original text for formatting
- make the output easy to read
- make the output mobile friendly
- be accessible from other devices through wifi
