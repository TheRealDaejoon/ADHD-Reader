I am trying to make an adhd reader.

AIMS:
- make the first few letters of every word bold, the number of bold letters will depend on the length of the word.
- change the font to a more readable font
- has to be a chrome extension (this is because I assume most users will use it on websites and also you can open
documents with chrome browser and one of my aims is to 'translate' documents too

Update 07/10/2024:
Had a go at walktheDOM. I did manage to separately get the walk working however when applying the algorithm it makes everything bold, not the first few letters.

TODO:
Find out if it is the walkDOM function or the actual formatting in the end (this one is more likely I think).
Explore external API methods - might be easier.
Consider limitations of walkDOM if the HTML is badly structured.

[NOTE]
readme and adhdtext file are not part of the chrome extension code, the textfile is just a record of the working algorithm.
